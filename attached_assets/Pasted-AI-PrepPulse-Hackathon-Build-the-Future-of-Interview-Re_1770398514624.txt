AI PrepPulse Hackathon 
Build the Future of Interview Readiness 
THE CHALLENGE: 
Every year, millions of students graduate and enter the job market, but many struggle to 
assess whether they're truly ready for interviews. They often discover gaps in their 
preparation only after failed interviews - when it's too late. 
Your Mission: Create an innovative tool that helps students objectively measure their 
interview readiness and identify areas for improvement BEFORE they face real recruiters. 
PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Design and develop a solution that evaluates different aspects of interview preparation 
like Technical Skills, Resume, Communication gaps, Portfolio.

Readiness Score" with personalized improvement plans. 
Important Note: The evaluation process via this tool should not take more than 2 min. 
of total time spent by the candidate.
